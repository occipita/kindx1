Kind language interpreter

An experimental version in Java, intended for experiments in Object model semantics.

(Using an old version of java to allow code to run on Android 4.x, as this is my current
development platform; files are in datestamped zip files as I have been unable to find 
a working git implementation for this platform, so am using zip in lieue of real version
control)
